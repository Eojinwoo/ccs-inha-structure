## This workflow demonstrates a comprehensive process for:

1. Generating the 'top' and 'bottom' surfaces of an anticline.
1. Converting these surfaces into a structural grid.
1. Rasterizing the formation with specified parameters for NX, NY, and NZ.
1. Visualizing the results using the versatile capabilities of PyVista.
1. Incorporating essential geostatistical properties such as facies and porosity.

We believe this workflow offers valuable insights into efficiently generating synthetic yet realistic surfaces applicable to Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), hydrogen (H2) storage, or hydrocarbon development. It was developed during our research into integrating 4D seismic data in CCS workflows.

To access the workflow, simply open the **"main.ipynb"** file. It includes comprehensive instructions on how to implement this demonstration.
